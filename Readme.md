# AquaSol 
Yield Stripping Protocol on Solana

AquaSol is a Solana-based protocol that splits yield-bearing assets into two tokens:

Principal Token (PT) â†’ Represents the underlying asset, redeemable at maturity.

Yield Token (YT) â†’ Represents the right to the assetâ€™s yield until maturity.

This primitive unlocks fixed income trading, yield speculation, and structured DeFi products on Solana.

## Features
ðŸ”¹ Asset Registry â†’ On-chain registry for supported yield-bearing assets.

ðŸ”¹ Yield Stripping â†’ Convert deposits into PT + YT tokens.

ðŸ”¹ Yield Accrual â†’ Claim yield proportionally as YT holder.

ðŸ”¹ Redemption â†’ Redeem PT for underlying at maturity.

ðŸ”¹ Error Handling â†’ Robust custom errors for protocol safety.

ðŸ”¹ Modular Account Design â†’ asset, registry, user_yt_position modules for clean separation.

## Program Architecture
### Accounts
Registry â†’ Stores all supported assets.

Asset â†’ Metadata + state for each listed yield-bearing asset.

Vault â†’ Holds deposited underlying tokens.

User PT/ YT Accounts â†’ Track balances and entitlements.

### Instructions
init_registry â†’ Initialize the global registry.

list_asset â†’ Add a new yield-bearing asset.

strip â†’ Split asset into PT + YT.

claim_yield â†’ Claim yield generated by asset.

redeem â†’ Redeem PT for underlying after maturity.
